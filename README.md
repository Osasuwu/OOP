# OOP
Uni project for OOP.
Music Playlist Generator by any parameter.
1. It's open source, so you can modify/add any functionality that you need.
2. It has generated database formed from every user's listening history. You can add it from any source(if it doesn't have your variant, create it yourself)
3. You can toggle all parameters as you want when creating the playlist.
4. You can get the result in any format.

We tried to make the code as flexible as we can, so you don't have to dive deep in what every class does, just add what you need and it will work(hopefully).
It's written in java/maven
